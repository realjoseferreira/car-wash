# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:

## Test Plan for Backend Testing Agent

Please test all backend endpoints with the following:

**Test Credentials:**
- Username: admin1
- Password: 123
- Tenant ID will be in the login response

**Test Sequence:**

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - POST /api/auth/login with credentials
   - Verify access token and refresh token returned
   - Test token refresh with POST /api/auth/refresh

2. **Dashboard Analytics**
   - GET /api/dashboard with valid token
   - Verify revenue.today, revenue.last15Days, revenue.last30Days
   - Verify recentOrders array

3. **Clients CRUD**
   - GET /api/clients (list all)
   - POST /api/clients (create new with vehicle info)
   - PUT /api/clients/:id (update)
   - DELETE /api/clients/:id (delete)

4. **Services CRUD**
   - GET /api/services (list all)
   - POST /api/services (create new with price)
   - DELETE /api/services/:id (delete)

5. **Orders CRUD**
   - GET /api/orders (list all)
   - POST /api/orders (create with multiple items from catalog)
   - PUT /api/orders/:id (update status to 'paid')
   - GET /api/orders/:id (get single with items)

6. **PDF Generation**
   - GET /api/orders/:id/pdf (download PDF)
   - Verify PDF file is returned

7. **Team Management**
   - GET /api/team (list members)
   - POST /api/team/invite (send invite email)

**Important:**
- All requests except /api/auth/login need Authorization: Bearer {token}
- All requests need ?tenant_id={tenant_id} query parameter
- Test RBAC by checking permission denials for non-owner roles
- Verify multi-tenant isolation (queries should only return data for the current tenant)

**Notes:**
- System is using Railway PostgreSQL
- Email uses Ethereal (test email) by default
- Timezone is America/Sao_Paulo for revenue calculations
- All user-facing text is in Brazilian Portuguese

## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.
